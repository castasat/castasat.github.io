<h2>PranacoinWallet - How to remove user data</h2>

<p><strong>PranacoinWallet</strong> app collects user data such as Google sign-in account id
    to create pranacoin address. This behaviour is needed to provide the possibility to 
    restore the balance using user's Google account even if the user removed application and 
    reinstalled it lately or installed it on another device.</p>

<p>You can explicitely ask for removal of your pranacoin address and Google sign-in account id by
    sending email from your Google account to my address: castasat&commat;gmail.com (Denis 
    Dmitrienko aka Denis Castasat).</p>

<p>Otherwise your Google sign-in account id would be stored in mobile android app and pranacoin 
    address would be stored on the backend side of the service unless there are notices about 
    changes in our user data storage policy or law regulations forcing to do otherwise.</p>

<p>We may update this document from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting
    the new instructions. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this
    page.</p>
